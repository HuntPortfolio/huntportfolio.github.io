		<h1>Apocalyptic, in a Sense.</h1>

		<div style="text-align: justify;">
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once dreamt about being an astronaut.  I dreamt 
		of gripping my seat as my ship rumbled through the atmosphere during take-off.  
		I dreamt of slowly drifting through the endless, inky void.  I dreamt of being a 
		world away, experiencing new sights, scents, textures, echoes, rattles.  I dreamt 
		of something better, a place to be.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I imagined landing on a distant planet, somewhere outside 
		of our solar system.  The smooth, cyan ground was covered in a thick red fog.  As soon 
		as I stepped out of my ship, I was knocked back by blisteringly cold wind whipping at 
		my helmet.  My feet struggled to find grip in the shifting sands.  The terrain seemed 
		endless, there were no visible landmarks in any direction.  After waiting out the winds, 
		I ventured out to search for something.  The end goal wasn't very clear, but I trudged 
		along anyway to try and find some sort of bearing.</p>

		<p>Step by Step Guide to Better Technical Writing:</p>

		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-expression is not something that comes easily to 
		me, and I find writing about my previous works to be doubly hard.  I've been 
		reviewing my three projects and after careful deliberation, I've decided to 
		call them "okay."  I can't call my work stellar and I certainly don't consider 
		it anything ground-breaking or even terribly special.  However, I do see my 
		skill as a technical writer improving, and more importantly seeing my own work 
		no longer makes me embarrassed for the potential reader.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of the issues in my works are systemic, and 
		come from a fundamental misunderstanding of the prompt.  With 
		<a href="#">Project 1</a> I spent a sizable amount of time debating how to 
		even begin tackling the prompt.  The brainstorming and writing processes entwined 
		themselves into a nasty vortex in which nothing escaped; in the end I had nothing. 
		My writing background is almost entirely in <a href="http://www.writing.ucsb.edu/faculty/dean/Upload-STEP08/ThePoisonedFish.pdf">Engfish</a> and is a product of 
		the Massachusetts Public School System; my teachers would be ashamed to hear me say it, but it's an undeniable truth.  Adapting to this class required re-learning how 
		to write clearly and succinctly, the fluff would have to go.</p>
